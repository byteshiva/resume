== SUMARY
I'm looking to be part of a team, have a well defined role, and ownership over a product or service. When I spend time learning, its to become an expert at whatever I might be responsible for, so that I can help train and foster the working environment surrounding me.

I want to get involved with big projects and work with passionate people. I have a strong desire to work with a mobile, backend or frontend team to deliver quality products and services to happy customers.

My personality suits most. I'm a social kind of developer and easy to work with. I'm open to new ideas and like to share my opinions when I see an opportunity for improvement and efficiency within an organization.

=== What I’ve worked on in the past

* Improved geolocation accuracy -- migrated geolocation services from MaxMind to IP2Location without downtime, modifying platform or database schema migration

* Report authoring, a core analytics feature, to allow customers to create segmentation reports

* Led team web frontend refactor to help deliver unified experience across company

* Developed product mapping solution for many-to-many relationship using a connected sub-components and breadth-first search algorithm

* Mining big data using Apache Hadoop and Apache PigLatin

* Data analytics using Python Pandas, NumPy, SciKit Learn

* Real-time analytic software using C# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

* Crowd sourcing application using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Mechanical Turk (mTurk)

* Custom implementation of I2C bus and LPC bus in C for an embedded security platform

* Web portal written in SQL, PHP, JavaScript for team knowledge tracking application

=== Side Projects
I have many side projects, these projects get me involved in technologies to strengthen my abilities and satisfy my ambition for knowledge. Some of them are publicly available on my github account.

A particular project of mine that has had success is https://github.com/dtjohnson/xlsx-populate[xlsx-populate], where I have been able to collaborate online to create a NodeJS Excel framework.
